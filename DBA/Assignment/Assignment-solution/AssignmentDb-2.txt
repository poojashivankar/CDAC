ans=>

The primary key in a database table is the field (or set of fields) that uniquely identifies each record in the table.
If you're working with a specific database schema, you would need to
 look at the table definition or ask for clarification on which field is designated as the primary key.
 But usually, a customer ID (Cnum or CustomerID) serves this role.
In a Customers table, the most common field used as a primary key is typically something
 like Cnum (Customer Number) or CustomerID, because these fields uniquely identify each customer.


2) What is the 4th column of the Customers table? 

ans =>  the 4th column is Rating, which is an integer field. It stores the rating for the customers.


3) What is another word for row?  For column? 

ans =>  Another word for a row is a record or tuple.
        Another word for a column is a field or attribute.

4) Why isnâ€™t it possible to see the first five rows of a table?
ans =>In a Relational Database Management System there is no such thing as a first or last row in a table.
 The SQL language explicitly states that any RDBMS is free to return data in any order
 that is convenient unless the query contains an ORDER BY clause which then defines the order of returned rows
